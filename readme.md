#iPill
An automated pill dispensing system

#About
This project was done for the UCI Senior design course.  It was a project course where teams were tasked with creating an interesting product over the course of two quarters.  Our team decided to build an automated pill dispensing system based on a raspberry pi. THe code in the repo contains the UI built on the TKinter library, drivers for interfacing with and NFC reader and servo motors, and classes to store prescription information.
